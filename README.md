# GlobalME_MV-Demo
Version 0.1.0
A project to unite my public plugins in MV.

This project is a project to publish my plugins for RPG Maker MV. Individual Terms of Use are in the plugins themselves, make sure to read them! For most of them they are:


You are not allowed to use this raw project as your own, use only as a reference, modify your copy... But you can use all and any of the plugins in it for your projects.

I also accept requests if they are not too hard, I'm not so good as Yanfly and others! PM me on rpgmakerweb and in a couple of days I'll tell you if I can take the request.

For requests, we agree to the following terms (and may talk about some others):

- For paid requests:
I will get paid even if you hire someone else to do it too.
I can make it so people can't read it. (I will explain about this if you want to)
I am allowed to release it individually or in this demo 30 days past the release date of the game or the cancellation of the game. 


- For free requests:
You won't make me compete with others to see who makes it faster.
I won't make it illegible. (I will explain about this if you want to)
I will be able to release it as soon as the game is released or canceled. Exceptions may apply if the requester agrees.


- For both:
Follow the terms of use of the plugin.
Don't publish them without my permission, link the rpgmakerweb or universomaker post.
Follow GPL 2.1 minor license, even if I obscure it for you, you must provide a way for people to read it. RPG Maker Terms also say this.
I'm not developing your game. It's your choice how to make it reach the people.
I most likely won't need it nor ask for it, but I may ask for a early version of your project to make sure it all fits. I won't tell anyone about it without permission or it being canceled.
If you use it for something with credits, have me in referred as in rpgmakerweb!
We will consider it canceled after 6 months with no updates.
Never, ever, ever claim it as your own, so don't delete the author!

Happy RPG Making!
